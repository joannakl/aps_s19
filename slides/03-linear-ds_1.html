# Basic Linear Data Structures

- list
  - array
  - linked
- stack
- queue

--

Operations that determine performance of a data structure:

- insertion
- deletion
- query / find
- update / modify

--

__Data structures are separate from their implementations.__ For most there are many
different ways to implement them.

--

Most of the linear data structures are implemented in built-in libraries.

# List as a Static Array

_static array_ = fixed size, no need to resize it

- natively supported by both C/C++ and Java

- can be declared with appropriate size up-front if the problem specifies
the maximum input size (HINT: use extra buffer for safety to avoid
going out of bounds)

- can be multi-dimensional: 1D, 2D, 3D, ...

--

- allocated in memory as consecutive memory locations (important for fast accesses)

- assume that indexes in use are all in the front (starting at low indexes) and
there are no gaps

```
      -------------------------------------
      | 3 | 7 | -1| 0 | 15| -5|   |   |   |
      -------------------------------------
```

--

- performance of operations
  - insert/delete in the back O(1)
  - insert/delete in the front or _middle_ O(N)
  - update/modify O(???)
  - find O(???)

- performance of operations
  - insert/delete in the back O(1)
  - insert/delete in the front or _middle_ O(N)
  - update/modify: using index O(1), if need to find, then see below
  - find O(N) if not sorted, O(logN) if sorted

# List as a Static Array

__Java 1D and 2D static array__

```Java
int[] a;                       // declare the array
a = new int[n];                // create the array
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)    // elements are indexed from 0 to n-1
   a[i] = 1;                   // initialize all elements to 1
```
```Java
double[][] a;                   // declare a 2D array
a = new double[m][n];           // create a 2D array with m rows and n columns
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)     // initialize all values to 0
   for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
      a[i][j] = 0;
```

__C/C++__

```C++
int a[n];                      // declare/create the array
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)    // elements are indexed from 0 to n-1
   a[i] = 1;                   // initialize all elements to 1
```

```C++
double a[m][n];                 // declare/create a 2D array with m rows and n columns
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)     // initialize all values to 0
   for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
      a[i][j] = 0;
```

# List as a Dynamic/Resizable Array

- implementation provided by buil-in classes:
  - `vector` in C++ STL
  - `ArrayList` or `Vector` in Java (`ArrayList` is faster because it
  is unsynchronized)

- used when required size is not known at compile time

--

__performance of operations__

use __amortized analysis__: average/amortized performance of a sequence of operations
rather than each single operation <br>
reason ???

__performance of operations__

use __amortized analysis__: average/amortized performance of a sequence of operations
rather than each single operation <br>
reason: because this way the cost of a resize and copy of data is averaged
out <br>
(works only if resizing is done by multiplicative factor)

--

  - insert/delete in the back O(1)
  - insert/delete in the front or _middle_ O(N)
  - update/modify: using index O(1), if need to find, then see below
  - find O(N) if not sorted, O(logN) if sorted

---
# List as a Linked Structure
## (a Linked List)


- implementation provided by buil-in classes:
  - `list` in C++ STL
  - `LinkedList`  in Java

- rarely used due to poor performance of accessing elements

- (good exercise: implement your own in both Java and C++ to
practice reference/pointer operations)

- performance of operations
  - insert/delete in the back/front O(1) (assume a doubly linked)
  - insert/delete in the _middle_ O(N)
  - update/modify: O(N) (except for in the front/back)
  - find O(N)

# List _Hybrids_

- dynamically allocated list that consists of short fixed sized arrays that
are connected into a linked list

.center[<img src="img/linked_arrays.png" alt="linked array" width = "60%"/>]

--

- linked list in which the "links" are provided by indexes in a separate
array


.center[<img src="img/linked_by_index.png" alt="linked by index" width = "60%"/>]

# Challenge

.left-column2[
Given a `head` pointer/reference to a singly linked list, determine if it has a loop.

Determine the length of the loop if it exists.

Restrictions:
- Elements in the list are not unique.
- Do not use extra storage.

.below-column2[

__Solution__ Rabbit and Turtle (two pointers)
- start two pointers at head
- advance rabbit two steps per iteration
- advance turtle one step per iteration
- if they meet (i.e., rabbit does not find the end of the list)
then there is a loop and a note at which they meet is somewhere on the loop
- trace through the loop with one of them to determine the number of nodes in
the loop
]

# Challenge


- Can a singly linked list be circular?

- Can a doubly linked list be circular?

- Can a doubly linked list have a loop?

# Stacks

---
# Stack (first in last out, FILO)


- implementation provided by buil-in classes:
  - `stack` in C++ STL
  - `Stack`  in Java

--

- operations performed
    - add/push O(1) - adds to the top
    - remove/pop O(1) - removes from the top
    - top O(1) - access the element on the top (optional)
    - empty O(1) - determine if the stack is empty (optional)

--

- used in many algorithms for solving problems
  - postfix, prefix calculations and conversions
  - graph algorithms

# Challenge: Function Call Stack

What is the output of `fun(4)` ?

```C++
void fun (int x ) {
  if (x == 0) return;
  printf ("%d\n", x);
  fun(x-1);
}
```

--

Output
```
4
3
2
1
```

# Challenge: Function Call Stack

# Challenge: Function Call Stack

How about these functions? (Try it on your own after the class. )
.left-column2[
```C++
void fun (int x ) {
  if (x == 0) return;
  printf ("%d ", x);
  fun(x-1);
  fun(x-1);
  printf ("%d ", x);
}
```
]
.right-column2[
```C++
void fun (int x, int y ) {
  if ( abs(x) >= 3 || abs(y) >= 2)
    return;
  printf ("%d %d\n", x, y);
  fun(x-1, y+1);
  fun(x  , y-1);
  fun(x+1, y-1);
  printf ("%d %d\n", x, y);
}
```
