# Greedy


- solving problems by making locally (at each step) optimal choices with
the hope of obtaining optimal solution overall

- when does it work
    - problem has optimal sub-structure: optimal solution for the problem
      contains optimal solutions for sub-problems
    - problem has a greedy property: optimal choices made at the moment
      lead to otpimal overall solution (no need to go back and explore
      an alternative)

- examples

# Challenge: Making Change

__Task__

Given an amount V (in cents) and a list of denominations of n coins find
the way to make the change with the minimum number of coins.
Assume that you have unlimited supply of each coin (for each given denomination).

---
# Challenge: Making Change

__Example__

- n = 4
- denominations = {25, 10, 5, 1} cents
- desired amount V = 47 cents

solution:
- start with the largest denomination and use as many coins as possible<br>
  47 - 25 = 22
- use the next highest denomination <br>
  22 - 10 = 12 <br>
  12 - 10 = 2 <br>
- the remaining amount is too small for the denomination of 5, so skip it
- use the last denomination <br>
  2 - 1 = 1 <br>
  2 - 1 = 0 <br>

so we need 5 coins: 25, 10, 10, 1, 1



---
# Challenge: Making Change

This problem posseses both characteristics that make the greedy solution
applicable here:

- the solutions to its subproblems are optimal, for example
    - for 22 cents, the otpimal solution would be 4 coins: {10, 10, 1, 1}
    - for 12 cents, the optimal solution would be 3 coins: {10, 1, 1}

- the solution has a greedy property: we use the largest possible
coin first, if we used a smaller one instead, we would have to replace that
coin with more than one coin in the alternative solution.

_Note_<br>

This approach does not work for all denominations. It does work for
American coins of {25, 10, 5, 1} cents.

# [Station Balance](slides/Station.pdf)

__Task__

Given a number of chambers $1 \leq C \leq 5$ and a number of specimens $1 \leq S \leq 2C$
and a list of $M$ masses for each specimen, determine how to distribute the
specimens between the chambers so that their _imbalance_ is as small as possible.

Restriction: each chamber can store 0, 1, or 2 specimens.

The _imbalance_ is calculated as

$$ \text{Imbalance}= \sum_{i=1}^{C}{|X_i - A|} $$

where $A$ is the average weight that each chamber needs to carry $A = (\sum_{i=M}^{S}{M_j})/C$
and $X_i$ is the total weight of the specimens at chamber $i$.


---
## Station Balance

__Example__

C = 3<br>
S = 4<br>
M = {5, 1, 2, 7}


The average weight A = (5+1+2+7)/3 = 5

A possible assignment (not optimal):

C1 = 7, 5 <br>
C2 = 2 <br>
C3 = 1 <br>

Imbalance = | 7+5 - 5| + |2 - 5| + | 1- 5| = 14

--

__Observation 1__: If there is an empty chamber in the final solution, than it is always
beneficial (in the sense that the new solution is not worse than the original) to move
one specimen from a chamber with two specimens to the empty one. Otherwise, the empty
chamber contributes more to the imbalance than the alternative assignment.

__Observation 2__: If S > C, then S - C specimens must be placed into chambers that
already contain other specimens.



---
## Station Balance

__Solution__

- If S <= C, then place each specimen in its own chamber. Some chambers might be empty.

- If S > C, then
    - create 2C - S dummy specimens with weight zero
    - sort 2C specimens (including the dummy ones)
    - pair the specimens from the beginning and end of the sorted list (i.e., smallest
    with largest, second smallest with second largest, ... until all are used) and
    place each pair in a chamber

.small[

__Example__

C = 3, S = 4, M = {5, 1, 2, 7}

The average weight A = (5+1+2+7)/3 = 5

M with dummy specimens = { 5, 1, 2, 7, 0, 0}

sorted M with dummy specimens = {0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 7}

Optimal specimens to chamber assignment:

C1 = 7 <br>
C2 = 5 <br>
C3 = 1, 2 <br>

Imbalance = | 7 - 5| + |5 - 5| + | 3 - 5| = 4
