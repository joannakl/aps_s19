# Stack (first in last out, FILO)


- implementation provided by buil-in classes:
  - `stack` in C++ STL
  - `Stack`  in Java

--

- operations performed
    - add/push O(1) - adds to the top
    - remove/pop O(1) - removes from the top
    - top O(1) - access the element on the top (optional)
    - empty O(1) - determine if the stack is empty (optional)

# Challenge: Brackets Matching

Given a mathematical expression containing parentheses, i.e., `(` and `)`, determine if the
expression is valid.

Example:

`()(())` => valid

`)()(())(` => invalid

`()()(` => invalid


--

------

- Can you solve it without using any data structures (i.e., no stack)?

--

- Can you solve it for different types of brackets in a single expression?

  `{()()}[(())]` => valid

  `{)()(]` => invalid

  `(){(})` => invalid

---

# Challenge: Brackets Matching

__Solution with one kind of brackets__:

- keep an integer that starts at zero
- for each opening bracket increment it
- for closed bracket decrement it (if less than zero, INVALID)

if the value at the end is zero, then VALID, otherwise INVALID

--

__Solution for mixed brackets__:

- keep a stack of characters
- for each opening brackets, push it on the stack
- for each closing bracket,
  - if matches top of the stack, then pop the stack
  - otherwise, INVALID  (this covers empty stack as well)

if the stack is empty, then VALID, otherwise INVALID


--

__What is the time complexity of these algorithms?__

--

- Linear in the length of the input string expression.

---
# Exercise

Can we use dynamic/resizable array (`vector` in C++ or `Vector` in Java)
to provide efficient implementation of a stack?

- If so, figure out how to do it (i.e., determine which functions
in those classes give provide the functionality that is
required by the stack).

# Evaluating Mathematical Expressions

Evaluate an arithmetic expression with only operators and numbers:

- `1 + 2 + 3    =>  6`
- `1 + 2 * 3    =>  7`
- `1 * 2 * 3    =>  6`
- `1 * 2 + 3    =>  5`

--

Do the same with added parenthesis:

- `1 + 2 * 3    =>  7`
- `(1 + 2) * 3    =>  9`
- `1 * 2 + 3    =>  5`
- `1 * (2 + 3)    =>  6`

--

The code that can evaluate such expressions has to:
- find and evaluate all subexpressions
- for each operator figure out what its operands are

It is easier if we can ignore the parenthesis and not have to
worry about the operator precedence.

---

# Prefix  and Postfix Notations
### (a.k.a. Polish and Reverse Polish Notation)

__Infix notation__ is a notation for writing human readable arithmetic
expressions in which the operator appears _in-between_ its operands.

[__Prefix notation__](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation)
is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in
which the operator comes _before_ its operands.

[__Postfix notation__](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)
is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in
which the operator comes _after_ its operands.

| infix          | prefix           | postfix      |
| :--------------| :--------------- | :----------- |
| `2 + 5`        |  `+ 2 5`         | ` 2 5 + `    |
| `(2 + 4) * 5`  | `* + 2 4 5`      | ` 2 4 + 5 *` |
| `2 + 4 * 5`    |  `+ 2 * 4 5`     | ` 2 4 5 * +` |

---

# Evaluate Prefix Expressions


- scan the given prefix expression from right to left
- for each token in the input prefix expression
  - if the token is an operand then
      - push onto a stack
  - else if the token is an operator then
      - operand1 = pop stack
      - operand2 = pop stack
      - compute operand1 operator operand2
      - push result onto stack
- return top of stack as result

---

# Evaluate Postfix Expressions


- scan the given postfix expression from left to right
- for each token in the input postfix expression
  - if the token is an operand
      - push it (its value) onto a stack
  - else if the token is an operator
      - operand2 = pop stack       (!!!)
      - operand1 = pop stack
      - compute operand1 operator operand2
      - push result onto stack
- return top of the stack as result

---
# Convert Infix to Postfix

- for each character in the input infix string expression
  - if the character is an operand
      - append to postfix string expression
  - else if the character is a left brace
      - push it onto the operator stack
  - else if the character is an operator
      - if the stack is not empty
          - while top element on the stack has higher precedence
              - pop the stack and append to postfix string expression
      - push it (the current operator) onto the operator stack
  - else if the character is a right brace
      - while the operator stack is not empty
          - if the top of the operator stack is not a matching left brace
              - pop the operator stack and append to postfix string expression
          - else
              - pop the left brace and discard
              - break
- while the operator stack is not empty
  - pop the operator stack and append to postfix string expression

---
# Exercise

Apply the infix to postfix conversion to the following expression:
$$4 + (5 * 6) / (1 + 2 + 3) $$

Show the content of the operator stack and the postfix expression after each
iteration of the outermost for loop.

--

You should end up with `4 5 6 * 1 2 + 3 + / +`.

# Queues

---
# Queues (first in first out, FIFO)


- implementation provided by buil-in classes:
  - `queue` in C++ STL
  - `Queue`  in Java (note that this is an interface that
  is implemented by several different classes in Java)

--

- operations performed
    - add/enqueu/push O(1) - adds to the back of the queue
    - remove/dequeue/pop O(1) - removes from the front of the queue
    - empty O(1) - determine if the stack is empty (optional)



---

# Array as an Efficient Queue

--

- keep track of front (first element) and back (last element)


.center[<img src="img/queue_array_1.PNG" alt="queue array" width = "50%"/>]


--

- what do we do if the back reaches the end of the array?


.center[<img src="img/queue_array_2.PNG" alt="queue array back at end" width = "50%"/>]

--

  use circular array (and modular arithmetic) to rotate and move back
  to the beginning of the array (low indexes)

  .center[<img src="img/queue_array_3.PNG" alt="queue array back at end" width = "50%"/>]

---

# Array as an Efficient Queue



- how do we distinguish between an empty and full queue? (what should
be the values of front and back _pointers_ for an empty queue?)


.left-column2[<img src="img/queue_array_4.PNG" alt="queue array back at end" width = "80%"/>

When the last element is removed, the front moves in front of the back. But this is also the
case for the full array.

]

--

.right-column2[<img src="img/queue_array_5.PNG" alt="queue array back at end" width = "80%"/>]

--

.below-column2[
- Keep track of the number of elements in the queue.

- Allocate large enough array that full never happens.
]

# Deque


- implementation provided by buil-in classes:
  - `deque` in C++ STL
  - `Deque`  in Java (note that this is an interface that
  is implemented by several different classes in Java)

--

- operations performed
    - push front, push back O(1) - add to either end of the deque
    - pop front, pop back O(1) - remove from either end of the deque
    - empty O(1) - determine if the deque is empty (optional)

# Challenge

Given a list of N positive integers (1 <= N <= 10^6), compute for each
element A[i], what is the smallest element to its left (excluding itself).

Sample:


```
       -----------------------------
array: | 5 | 4 | 8 | 3 | 9 | 2 | 10|
       -----------------------------
```
```
       -----------------------------
array: | --| 5 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 |
       -----------------------------
```
