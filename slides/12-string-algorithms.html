## String Definitions

a __string__ `s` of length $n$ consists of characters `s[0]`, `s[1]`, ..., `s[n-1]`

a __substring__ `s[a..b]` is a sequence of consecutive characters in a string
that starts at position `a` and ends at position `b` (inclusive on both ends)

a __prefix__ is a substring for which `a=0`

a __suffix__ is a substring for which `b=n-1`

a __subsequence__ is any sequence of characters in a string in their original
order (not necesserily consecutive)



---
# Longest Common Subsequence

The __longest common subsequence__ (lcs) of two strings is the longest string
that appears as a subsequence in both strings.

Examples:

- "floor" and "door", the lcs is "oor"
- "caged" and "rage", the lcs is "age"
- "capsule" and "recaps", the lcs is "caps"

--

__Solution__

given: two strings `x` and `y`

`lcs(i,j)` - function that returns length of the longest common
subsequence of the prefixes `x[0..i]` and `y[0..j]`

```
      lcs(i,j) =

         lcs(i-1,j-1)+1,      when  x[i]=y[j]

         max(lcs(i-1,j), lcs(i,j-1) ),  otherwise
```

# Edit Distance

The __edit distance__ between two strings is defined as the minimum number
of editing operations that transform one string into the other.

The allowed operations may vary, but are often
- insert a character, "ABC" -> "ABCA"
- remove a character, "ABC" -> "AC"
- replace a character, "ABC" -> "ADC" <br>
  (this one can be thought of as two separate operations of remove followed by insert)

--

__Solution__

given: two strings `x` and `y`

`edit(i,j)` - function that returns the edit distance between
the prefixes `x[0..i]` and `y[0..j]`

--

```
      edit(i,j) =  min (
              edit(i, j-1) + 1,
              edit(i-1, j) + 1,
              edit(i-1, j-1) + cost(i,j)
            )
```
where `cost(i,j) = 0` when `x[i]=y[j]` and `cost(i,j) = 1`, otherwise.

              edit(i, j-1) + 1,           //insert character at the end of x
              edit(i-1, j) + 1,           //remove character from the end of x
              edit(i-1, j-1) + cost(i,j)  //replace the last char in x with the one from y
            )
```
where `cost(i,j) = 0` when `x[i]=y[j]` and `cost(i,j) = 1`, otherwise.

# Z-Array / Z-Algorithm

__What is a Z-array__?

--

The Z-array for a string `s` of length `n` is an array of length `n`
in which `Z[i]` stores the legnth of the longest substring starting
at `s[i]` that is also a prefix of `s`.

Example:

`s = "ABCABCABAB"`

```
index   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
  s     A  B  C  A  B  C  A  B  A  B
  Z     -  0  0  5  0  0  2  0  2  0

```


`s = "aaaaaa"`

```
index   0  1  2  3  4  5
  s     a  a  a  a  a  a
  Z     -  5  4  3  2  1

```


--

__What is a Z-Algorithm__?

--

It's an algorithm that computes the Z-Array for a given string `s`.

---

## Z-Algorithm

Idea: mantain a range `[l,r]` such that `s[l..r]` is a prefix of `s`,
the value of `Z[l]` has been calculated and `r` is as large as possible.

Observation: `s[l..r]` is the same as `s[0..r-l]`

```
initialize: l=0, r=0, c=1

for each c = 1 .. n-1

  if c > r (no prefix substring that starts before c and ends after c)
      set l = c
      set r = c
      set i = 0
      while s[i] is equal to s[r]
          i++
          r++
      set z[c] = r-l+1
  else if c <= r AND c+z[c-l] <= r
      (s[0..r-l] and s[l..r] are equal, and we stay within the range)
      set z[c] = z[x-r]
  else if c <= r AND x+z[c-x] > r
      (we know that z[c] >= r - c+1, so we need to make comparison between
        characters starting at positions r-c+1 and r+1)
      set i = 1
      while s[r-c+i] is equal to s[r+i]
        i++
        r++
      set z[c] = r-l+1
```

# Challenge: Pattern Matching

Find all locations of a pattern string `p` in a given string `s`.

--

__Solution__

- create a new string `p#s` in which `#` is a special character that does not
occur in neither `p` nor `s`
- create the z-array for the new string
- the locations in the z-array for which the value is equal to the length
of the pattern string `p` are the location of the pattern in `s` (adjust indexes
by subtracting the `length(p)+1`)

# Challenge: Finding Borders



A __border__ in a string is a substring that is both a prefix and a sufix of that
string (but not the entire string, i.e., proper prefix and proper suffix).

Example:

`s = ABACABACABA`

the borders are

```
          -
A         ABACABACABA
                    -

          ---
ABA       ABACABACABA
                  ---

          -------
ABACABA   ABACABACABA
              -------


```


---

# Challenge: Finding Borders


__Solution__

- create the z-array for `s`
- boarders are all suffixes `s[k..n-1]`, such that `k+z[k]=n`


```
index   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
  s     A  B  A  C  A  B  A  C  A  B  A
  Z     -  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

```

--

```
index   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
  s     A  B  A  C  A  B  A  C  A  B  A
  Z     -  0  1  0  7  0  1  0  3  0  1

                    |           |     |

```

# Knuth-Morris-Pratt’s (KMP) Algorithm

Another algorithm for pattern matching in strings.

It uses the observation that when a mismatch occurs,
the pattern itself contains sufficient information to
determine where the next match could begin. This allows to
skip re-examination of previously matched characters.

Example of the idea:

```
                    1         2
index:    01234567890123456789012
string:   ABC ABCDAB ABCDABCDABDE
pattern:  ABCDABD
```
