# Dynamic Programming


- solving problems by making locally (at each step) optimal choices with
the hope of obtaining optimal solution overall

- when does it work
    - problem has optimal sub-structure: optimal solution for the problem
      contains optimal solutions for sub-problems
    - problem has a greedy property: optimal choices made at the moment
      lead to otpimal overall solution (no need to go back and explore
      an alternative)

- examples

# Challenge: Making Change

__Example__

- n = 4
- denominations = {25, 10, 5, 1} cents
- desired amount V = 47 cents

solution:
- start with the largest denomination and use as many coins as possible<br>
  47 - 25 = 22
- use the next highest denomination <br>
  22 - 10 = 12 <br>
  12 - 10 = 2 <br>
- the remaining amount is too small for the denomination of 5, so skip it
- use the last denomination <br>
  2 - 1 = 1 <br>
  2 - 1 = 0 <br>

so we need 5 coins: 25, 10, 10, 1, 1

# Challenge: Making Change

This problem posses both characteristics that make the greedy solution
applicable here:

- the solutions to its subproblems are optimal, for example
    - for 22 cents, the otpimal solution would be 4 coins: {10, 10, 1, 1}
    - for 12 cents, the optimal solution would be 3 coins: {10, 1, 1}

- the solution has a greedy property: we use the largest possible
coin first, if we used a smaller one instead, we would have to replace that
coin with more than one coin in the alternative solution.
