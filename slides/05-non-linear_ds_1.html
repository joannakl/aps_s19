# Binary Trees

---
# Balanced Binary Search Tree

- binary tree
- for each node
  - all the values in the left subtree are smaller than the value in that node
  - all the values in the right subtree are greater than the value in that node
  - (equal values should be stored in one of the subtrees, if allowed)

--

- `map`/`set`/`multiset` in C++ and  `TreeMap` / `TreeSet` in Java

  - the _map_ versions of the classes store `(key, value)` pairs
  - the _set_ versions of the classes store only keys
  - the `multiset` (only in C++) allows duplicate keys

--

- $O(log N)$ on
  - add key,
  - remove key,
  - find key ,
  - find min/max,
  - successor/predecessor key

--

- AVL tree, Red-Black tree


---
# Binary Heap / Priority Queue

- a complete binary tree (all levels are filled except for the lowest one, the
lowest one is filled from left to right)

- for each node the values of its children are
    - smaller than or equal to the one in the node (max-heap)
    - larger than or equal to the one in the node (min-heap)

--

- `priority_queue` in C++, `PriorityQueue` in Java

- usually implemented using compact arrays

--

- $O(log N)$ operations :
  - add
  - remove

  because they require traversal along a single path from root to leaf

- _top_ should be $O(1)$

--

- building a heap from a collection of values is $O(N)$ !!!

  Why?

---

# Hash Table

- mapping from _keys_ to _values_ not sorted in any particular/predictable way

- lookups by key can be done in $O(1)$ (assuming a good hash function, but $O(N)$ worst case)

- addition / removal done in $O(1)$ (but $O(N)$ worst case)

--

- [`unordered_map`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_map/unordered_map/?kw=unordered_map)
in C++ () - starting in C++11 standard

- `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `HashTable` in Java

--

- challenge: depends on a well designed hash function
(and that is often tricky)

--

- Direct Addressing Table (DAT) is the simplest form of a hash
table in which _keys_ are the indexes - it is simply an array


---
# Challenge

For each o the following problems 1) come up with tests that could be used
for the implementation, 2) come up with an algorithm(s) that can be used to solve
the problem, 3) what is the performance of your algorithms? 

- Given `N` integers in arbitrary order find `k` largest ones.

- Given a root to a binary tree containing `N` nodes, determine
if it is a binary search tree?

- Given a binary search tree containing `N` nodes,
output the elements with values in the range [a..b] in ascending
order.

- Given a binary search tree containing `N` nodes, output
the values in the leaves in ascending order.

- A basic max-heap does only supports additions and removal of the max
element. How would you implement the following two operations:
  - `update(index, new_value)` - modify the value at a specified index to the new_value
  - `delete(index)` - deletes the value at a specified index
